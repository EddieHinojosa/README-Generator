<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<p>This is a README.md generator, this will allow you to use the command-lines to create a readme file based on the preset questions, such as "Project title, contributors, descriptions, etc"<br>
This can be used as a starting template when crate a project to reduce the amount of time it takes you to create a README file.
</p>


## How It Works:

<p>In teh file "Develop", run "node index.js", this will prompt the questions located in teh index.hs file and with the use of the generateMarkdown.js, it'll plug in your responses into a preset ReadMe template inwith your responses will be placed in the corresponding spots. </p>
